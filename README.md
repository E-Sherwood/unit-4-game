A simple jQuery "rpg" game.
<--------------------------->
player chooses a mage "champion"
player chooses first opponent
player clicks "Cast" to attack the defender
if player wins, "battle won" alert appears
if player loses, "battle lost" alert appears
<------------------------------------------->
functionality to be added later:
when player wins, choose second opponent and battle.
when second battle is won, player battles last opponent.
when player wins 3rd battle, show "you are the new Archmage, game over"
add "new game" button to reset page after "begin"

if player loses second battle, "battle lost" alert appears.
if player wins 2nd but loses 3rd battle, "battle lost" alert appears
add "new game" button to reset page after "begin"
<------------------------------------------------>
fluff to possibly add later for style:
animations to show attack/receiving attack?
sounds of spell casting depending on character chosen?
